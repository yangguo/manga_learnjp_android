# Debug Analysis for Manga Learn JP Android App

## Issues Identified

1. **API Not Working**
   - Added extensive debugging to AIService
   - Fixed AIConfig.getConfiguredProviders() to only include properly configured providers
   - Added validation to ensure API keys are present before making requests

2. **Logging Not Working**
   - Added println() and android.util.Log.d() calls alongside Logger calls
   - This will help identify if the custom Logger is the issue or if the methods aren't being called

## Key Changes Made

### AIService.kt
- Added debugging statements to trace execution flow
- Fixed initialization to validate API keys before use
- Enhanced error handling with multiple logging methods

### AIProvider.kt  
- Fixed getConfiguredProviders() to check if providers are actually configured
- Primary provider is now only added if it has valid configuration

### MainActivity.kt
- Fixed StateFlow.value usage in Compose context
- Changed to use collectAsState() properly

### AISettingsScreen.kt
- Fixed deprecated ArrowBack icon import

## Testing Steps

1. Install the app on device/emulator
2. Check logcat for debug messages:
   ```
   adb logcat | grep MangaLearnJP
   ```
3. Upload an image and trigger analysis
4. Check what providers are being attempted
5. Verify API key configuration

## Potential Root Causes

1. **No API Key Configured**: App might be trying to use APIs without keys
2. **Network Issues**: Check internet connectivity and API endpoints
3. **Logging Framework**: Custom Logger might not be outputting to logcat
4. **Configuration Issues**: AIConfig might not be persisting properly

## Next Steps

1. Run app and check logcat output
2. Configure at least one API provider properly
3. Test with a simple image
4. Verify error messages show the actual problem
